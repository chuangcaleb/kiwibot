## Using the chabot

### 1. Dependencies

Ensure you have the following non-standard python libraries installed in your environment:

- `nltk`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

### 2. Building

Before the chabot can operate, first build and train the model by running

```

This will read `intents.json` and create a `.pickle` file, which will be our trained model.

Now you can run the command-line chatbot by executing in a terminal of your choice:

```python
python main.py
```
